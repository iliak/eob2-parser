             Eye of the Beholder II
		Item List Stuff
	Maelwys Goldenmoon maelwys@inwave.com

        In a fit of complete boredom one day, I thought it actually
might be fun to wade through the hex code on the Eye of the
Beholder II save file and change some values and such. I give many,
many thanks to Silver Rainmaker for his file on editing the basic
values and attributes. It's quite helpful and if you're playing
the game and want to toy with those things, I suggest you grab it
and see what you can do. So after changing my characters around
completely and maxing them all out, I moved on to the items. Yay.
Anyway, I'm not going to cover the stuff S.R. already did, since I
don't feel like copying his work, instead I'm going to tell you
all about the items. First off, get yourself a Hex editor. Norton
Diskedit is the one I use and probably the most common to find.
It's very nice besides... so if you have it, use that. Before you
start fiddling with your character, it might be a good idea to go
ahead and save the file: eobsave* to a temporary directory just in
case you mess up royally. The * above is the number of y
our savefile in the game. It can be anything from 0 to 7, where 0
is the top savegame, 1 is the next, then 2, and so on and so forth up
to 7. Now, on to the editing. When you open the file, you see all that
fun hex stuff, looking something like this:

09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................

And thats it for the first character. It's long, confusing and really just a jumble of junk. I should note now that I
didn't bother to figure the pattern out for each character slot. The above is just the hex code for the -first-
character in your group, that is to say, the one on the top left. If you want to change the items on your other
characters you can either swap that character over to the Top/Left slot, or just give the items to your first character
and then in the game, have that character give them in turn to your other characters. Whatever works for ya.
Okay, the first 5 lines of that stuff up there are dealt with in S.R's list. They are the basics of your character, all
the attributes and such. The next 10 lines of zero's are nothing that I can tell. It's the following lines that I'll
deal with, the ones beginning with: 00 FA... in the above example.
Alrighty! Now on to the meat of the matter, and the part which is probably going to make you groan in agony. The item
lists change for each game you play! Yup, thats right... they aren't the same and what is one item in one of your games
is something completely different in another. The reason for this is because when you first start the game, your item
list is pretty blank. The only things on it are your starting gear and a few basic items: food, leather armor, daggers,
rocks, etc... As you play the game and find new things, they are assigned a hex value in the 'item database'. So
basically, if you want to find out where that +5 platemail from EOB1 is, you've got to plug in all the values on your
character until you get it. Now, just to keep you from tossing this document altogether and sending me hate mail, I
will tell you a few useful things. First of all, I've found that a few of the hex codes do seem to be the same for
every game you play. And if you plug these values in, they -should- be what I say they are. I'm not guaranteeing it,
but it's worth a shot. Also, I've also figured out which slot covers which codes on the character. So I'll get into
that right now.
Okay, in your character file, items are designated by two hex digits, starting with the: FA 00. That is to say, FA 00
is your first item. All the items on your character follow that same pattern. Each, uses a primary hex code, anywhere
from 01 to FF and then a secondary, which is anywhere from 00 to 03. This is because in the game there are a lot more
than 254 items, and there is an item slot for each and every item you can possibly have. Each rock you find or create,
each scroll and potion has its own code. It's an extrememly wasteful bit of writing really, since they actually only
need to give an item one slot, but it's the way the game was done and who am I to fault programmers. *snort*. So, lets
start with the first line, which looks like this:

00 FA 00 70 01 4E 01 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 B2 01 AA   ...p.N.........�

On this line, the first 00 doesn't do anything. So starting with the FA, we go right across, making two code bits out
of the entire line, till we have 7 full items and half of the eighth. That last single byte has its corresponding
secondary value on the beginning of the next line. Now, onto the slots used up.
And here goes: 'FA 00' is your Top Hand Held slot. '70 01' is your bottom hand held slot. 4E 01 is the first slot of
your backpack (Top/Left). The next two, designated by a '00 00' are the Top/Right slot of your backpack, and then the
following two, also '00 00' are the next row down, starting on the left. In that way, going sort of zigzagging down the
backpack slots, we run through all 14 backpack slots, moving on to the next lines:

00 C9 01 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 0E 02 00   ................
01 DA 01 BD 01 CE 00 98 - 00 00 00 90 01 00 00 00   .......�...�....
00 00 00 C4 01 C5 01 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................

The last backpack slot (Bottom/Right) is taken up here by the '00 01' at the end of the first line and moving on to the
beginning of the second line above. And then you move on to 'DA 01' which is your quiver. 'BD 01' is your armor slot,
'CE 00' is your wrists, '98 00' is whats on your head, the following two, '00 00' are your neck slot, and '90 01' are
on your feet. I pause here because the next three are your belt slots, the three slots on the right hand side of your
character picture, they are the three sets of '00 00' shown above. The next slot, 'C4 01' is your left ring slot, and
it finishes up with 'C5 01' which is your right ring slot.
All of those are basic and simple, as long as you know what items to plug in. A word of warning though: Make sure you
put only rings in the ring slots. If you put anything else in there, the game will crash when you go to open the
character portrait. Also, the quiver is a bit screwy. I've plugged a lot of different values in there and it changes
every time. It's possible to put anything in the quiver, I've pulled two-handed swords out of it before. But the quiver
works differently than the rest of the items. The hex sets which bring up an arrow are actually sets of arrows. Meaning,
if you find that the codes '4F 00' and '55 02' are both arrow pictures in your inventory, chances are that one of those
is actually a set of arrows, and that the value of that set only shows up if the arrow is put in the quiver slot.
Basically, the quiver is confusing as all hell and you shouldn't mess with it too much.
Now, as I promised, I compiled a short list of items that -seem- to be the same no matter what. I've only listed the
ones useful to a new party or to someone stuck somewhere. Like I said before, you might put in the value for +5 bracers
of protection and get a rock, but.... In any case, you -can- look at your other characters. If one of your characters
has those +5 bracers and you want to clone them, just put the bracers in your first characters backpack, find it in the
hex sets and copy the code a few times in the rest of your backpack slots. Thats probably the easiest way to go about
spreading the wealth. Anyway, here's that list:
  
04 01 - Troplet Seed
0A 00 - Iron Rations
11 00 - Grey Key
12 00 - Copper Key
12 01 - Potion of Extra Healing
13 01 - Potion of Vitality
18 00 - Potion of Giant Strength
1D 00 - Skull Key
1E 00 - Darkmoon Key
1F 01 - +3 Plate Mail
27 00 - Stone Gem Protal Key
28 00 - Stone Dagger Portal Key
29 00 - Stone Orb Portal Key
2A 00 - Stone Cross Portal Key
2A 01 - Long Sword "Hunger"
2B 00 - Stone Necklace Portal Key
33 00 - Composite Bow
40 00 - Bone Key
41 01 - Short Sword +3
44 00 - Red Gem
45 00 - Green Gem
46 00 - Blue Gem
47 00 - Purple Gem
48 00 - Mantis Key
49 00 - Mantis Idol
4A 00 - Polished Shield
4C 00 - Eye of Talon
4D 00 - Crystal Key
4E 00 - Shell Key
4F 00 - Tooth key
50 00 - Crimson Key
51 00 - Talon's Tounge
52 00 - Hilt of Talon
53 00 - Crystal Hammer
54 00 - Starfire Sceptre
56 00 - Crimson Ring
5C 00 - Sceptre of Kingly Might
5E 00 - Coin
5F 00 - Amulet of Life
75 00 - Cleric Scroll of Raise Dead
7C 00 - Rotten Food
7F 00 - Magic Dust
86 00 - +2 Short Sword "Sting"
8F 00 - Potion of Cure Poison
95 00 - Plate Mail +2
CE 00 - Bracers of Protection +5
E7 00 - +3 Cloak "Moonshade"
E8 00 - +2 Arrow (Just make a bunch of them in your backpack)

There are a few more that worked most of the time, but not with each party I tried. It seems that the lower numbers are
all the same, since they are for the most part very basic items. As you go up, the items get increasingly less stable
between parties.
If worse comes to worse, you can just flip back and forth between the game and Diskedit, plugging in each value one at
a time. If you use the two hand slots and all the backpack slots, thats 16 items you can find out about at once. And
doing it that way, you'd only have to go thru the process 48 times...

I hope this helps you gamers out there... If you find something else that you want to make a note of or you want to
trade some other help files like this back and forth or anything like that, drop me some email. That address about
should be mine for quite a while. And if you can't find me there, just look up Maelwys on the Web. Chances are, you'll
find me if you work at it a bit.

	Happy gaming!
